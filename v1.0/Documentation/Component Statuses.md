Unlike Incidents, Cachet starts listing Component statuses from **1**. When creating or updating a component, you'll need to specify a status for it.

A status can be one of the following:
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Status",
    "h-1": "Name",
    "h-2": "Description",
    "0-0": "`1`",
    "0-1": "Operational",
    "0-2": "The component is working.",
    "1-0": "`2`",
    "1-1": "Performance Issues",
    "1-2": "The component is experiencing some slowness.",
    "2-0": "`3`",
    "2-1": "Partial Outage",
    "2-2": "The component may not be working for everybody. This could be a geographical issue for example.",
    "3-0": "`4`",
    "3-1": "Major Outage",
    "3-2": "The component is not working for anybody."
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 4
